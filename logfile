- figure with the different disc added in visualisation_tools/plot_tools
- fixing SGD for barycenter search, using the mean in the tangent space instead of the sum, it caused divergence of the algorithm
in large dataset (depending of learning rate)

- Experiment script now can save parameters/results/embeddings/EM parameters in a folder given by the option --id (In Output folder?)
- Started experiments on DBLP, performances are currently low (~38%) waiting for end of the grid search
