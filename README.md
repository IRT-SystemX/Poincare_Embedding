# Poincaré Expectation Maximisation 

This package implements the expectation maximisation algorithm for the Poincaré manifold. 
A multi-dimensional setting is also implemented using the products of many Poincaré disks.

Poincaré disk with two Gaussians computed via graph embedding followed by exptectation maximisation algorithm for the Karate example dataset.


###The package contains the following modules:

* EM_Algorithm: implements the expectation maximisation algorithm
* EM_Embedding: implements the embedding of a graph structured data given an adjacency matrix then applies the EM algorithm 



### Package operation

Insert the dataset graph example as an adjacency matrix in the Input folder.
Open the Run_Embedding+EM.py script and fill the parameters.
Launch the script.
Check results in the Output folder.
