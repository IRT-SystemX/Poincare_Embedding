# Poincaré Expectation Maximisation 

This package implements the expectation maximisation algorithm for the Poincaré manifold. 
A multi-dimensional setting is also implemented using the products of many Poincaré disks. 

###The package contains the following modules:

* EM_Algorithm: implements the expectation maximisation algorithm
* EM_Embedding: implements the embedding of a graph structured data given an adjacency matrix then applies the EM algorithm 



### Package operation

Insert the dataset graph example as an adjacency matrix in the Input folder.
Open the Run_Embedding+EM.py script and fill the parameters.
Launch the script.
Check results in the Output folder.
